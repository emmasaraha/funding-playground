        How to meet the fund outcomes
      </h2>

      <p>Projects applying for funding will have to show (with evidence) how they will meet a common set of programme outcomes.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
        What are the outcomes
      </h3>

      <p><strong>All projects MUST meet the following outcome:</strong></p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          That your coastal community will benefit and are able to use their assets (physical, natural, environmental, social, economic and/or cultural) better while promoting sustainable economic growth and jobs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>All projects MUST MEET AT LEAST ONE of the following outcomes:</strong></p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          Deliver greater capacity to create a sustainable economic future where the coastal community is better equipped to adapt to change
        </li>
        <li>Demonstrate partnerships - within a community and/or across coastal communities -  which support economic innovation, enterprise and investment</li>
        <li>Demonstrate that people in the community have more opportunities for training and skill development, including volunteering</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
        Criteria checklist
      </h3>
      <p>Expanding on the outcomes you need to meet, proposals MUST demonstrate how they meet the following criteria:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><strong>Encourage sustainable economic growth.</strong> You must show how you proposal encourages economic growth in the area. Benefits will not have to be delivered within time limit, but you will have to define <strong>how</strong> and <strong>when</strong> they will be delivered. This provides assurance of the projects viability while allowing for medium / long term planning.</li>
        <li><strong>Demonstrate that the proposal fits with the broad economic priorities of the local area.</strong> Where possible, link this to your wider economic vision including private sector commitment and community support.</li>
        <li><strong>Demonstrate how the proposal unlocks barriers, addresses a need or opportunity within the area.</strong> Provide clear evidence of the barrier currently faced and how it will be overcome to provide benefit to the community.</li>
        <li><strong>Demonstrate (where appropriate) how your proposal contributes to green economic growth.</strong> Provide clear evidence of the economic benefit and its environmental focus.</li>
        <li><strong>Explain how you plan to work with other keys partners to deliver outcomes.</strong> This could be with public, private, voluntary, social enterprise or community sectors.</li>
        <li><strong>Where proposals involve flood and coastal erosion risk management</strong> include evidence that you are supported by either the Coastal Protection Authority (erosion), or the Environment Agency (flooding).</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>You must also demonstrate how Coastal Communities Fund support is vital to this projects success.</strong></p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
        Additional evidence
      </h3>
      <p>You should also look to include information on:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><strong>Risk.</strong> Be clear on the risks to your project you’ve already identified and how this risk will be managed.</li>
        <li><strong>Previous success.</strong> Where applicable, demonstrate your proven ability to manage and deliver projects, particularly if they involved infrastructure improvements</li>
        <li><strong>Match funding.</strong> If your bid includes match-funding, show how you’ve stress tested it against rules governing other funding sources.</li>
      </ul>
