            For the first round of bidding, applicants are not required to have all match funding sources secured at the
            time of project application.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            Capital funding for successful projects may be awarded in principle. However, successful applicants will
            need to demonstrate that they are able to secure the full project funds within <strong>6 months of application</strong>.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            There will be other opportunities to apply for funding after this round.</p>
